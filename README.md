## **Device + Location Goals:** 

**1. Market Efficiency**
 
Objective: To understand which markets are most and least effective for the client's campaigns. 

Top 10 Performing DMAs (Designated Market Areas): Identify the top 10 areas where the campaign has performed the best. 
Bottom 10 Performing DMAs: Identify the 10 areas where the campaign has performed the least effectively. 
Exclusion of Markets: Based on performance metrics, recommend markets that should be excluded from future campaigns to save budget and increase overall efficiency.<br>


<br>**2. Device Types & Operating Systems:**

Objective: To gauge the performance of various devices and their associated operating systems and inform future targeting. 

Top and Bottom Devices: Identify the top 10 and bottom 10 devices based on performance metrics. 
Performance Analysis: Investigate why certain devices are either performing well or underperforming. This could be due to device capabilities, user demographics, or other factors. 
Device Exclusion Recommendations: Suggest devices that the client should possibly exclude from future campaigns based on their performance and the reasons for their underperformance.<br>


<br>**3. Device Performance in Different DMAs:**

Objective: To understand how devices perform specifically in the best and worst performing markets. 

Top Devices in Top DMAs: Identify the best-performing devices in the top 10 DMAs. 
Top Devices in Bottom DMAs: Identify the best-performing devices even in the least effective DMAs.<br> 


<br>**4. Data Formatting & Naming:**

Objective: Ensure clarity and consistency in the data, especially concerning tablets which might be grouped under mobile strategies. 

Rename Strategies: If tablets are categorized under mobile, they should be renamed to reflect their specific device type for clarity, like changing "Mobile_RON" to "Tablet_RON".<br> 


<br>**5. Cost-Effectiveness of Devices and Locations:** 

Objective: To determine which devices and locations provide the best value for the money spent. 

Gross Cost: Includes the total cost of all media activity.
Net Cost: Cost incurred from running media.
Metrics like ROI (Return on Investment), CPA (Cost Per Acquisition), and ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) will be used to measure cost-effectiveness.<br> 

## **Audience Goals:**

**1. Top Performing Audiences & Personas:** 

Objective: Understand which audiences resonate most with the campaigns and create representative profiles. 

Top 10 Audiences: Identify the best-performing audience segments. 
Audience Personas: Based on the top-performing audiences, create at least 3 detailed personas to represent these segments for better-targeted campaigns.<br> 


<br>**2. Evidence & External Validation:** 

Objective: Ensure that the chosen strategies and audience segments are backed by solid evidence and external validation. 

This could involve referencing news articles, trends, or government regulations that align with the campaign's observations and findings.<br>


<br>**3. Naming Conventions:** 

Objective: Ensure clarity and consistency in naming conventions for different audience segments. 

Example: Instead of a lengthy "Geo-behavioral Audience > Lifestyle > Gym Goers > Healthy Lifestyle", it should be streamlined to "Lifestyle»Gym Goers»Healthy Lifestyle".<br> 


<br>**4. Cost-Effectiveness of Audiences:**

Objective: Determine which audience segments are most valuable based on the budget spent. 

Gross Cost: Includes the total cost of all media activity.
Net Cost: Cost incurred from running media.
Metrics like ROI, CPA, and ROAS will be used to measure cost effectiveness.<br> 

<br>Team 1's objectives revolve around optimizing the client's budget allocation by analyzing performance across different markets, devices, and audience segments. Through a combination of performance metrics, external validation, and data consistency efforts, they aim to provide actionable insights to enhance campaign efficiency and effectiveness. </br>
